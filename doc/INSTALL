How To Obtain
A stable version of JADE package can currently be directly from the https://github.com/jade-package

Currently, the JADE package is public accessible at github.com (a web-based Git repository hosting service). 
People who are interesting with the JADE program is direct to http://github.com/jade-package. 
A stable version of the JADE source code with the capability in this manuscript can be directly downloaded 
or by simply entering a git clone command. 
Since the JADE program is at the stage of rapid development, people are also welcomed to contact the authors 
to require the code with more features. 

--------------
In order to install and run JADE, you need the following:
o A Fortran90 compiler, This version has been tested against GNU Fortran (>4.4) and Intel Fortran (>11.0).
o The BLAS, LAPACK libraries, the intel mkl is preferred, if possible.
o Python 2 (version no. > 2.6) 

Suppose the package has been download at a new directory, named jade/
which should contains all the necessary subdirectories & files.

To compile the Fortran90 programs of the JADE package, go to the src/ directory.
cd src/
and edit the compiler.mk by adjusting the F90 variable to point to the Fortran compiler of your choice.
Issuing the command:
make
will compile the source and create all the binaries.
make install
will copy the binary files into the jade/bin/ directory.

if the compilation is successful
then, set the environment variable $JADE_HOME to the jade/ directory 
For example, if you have unpacked jade into your home directory, just set:
export JADE_HOME=~/jade (for bourne shell users)
or
setenv JADE_HOME $HOME/jade (for c-shell type users)
please note that it is advisable to put this line into your shell's login scripts.
finally, source the JADERC configuration
source ${JADE_HOME}/JADERC

END

Quantum Chemistry Programs
Because, the main application of JADE is certainly on-the-fly ab initio
dynamics. Hence, one of the following interfaced quantum chemistry programs is necessary:
o GAUSSIAN 03 or Gaussian 09
o Turbomole (tested against version no. > 6.1)
o GAMESS (US)(tested against version at 17 May 2013)
See the tests directory for the sample input of the quantum chemical methods available
with each of these programs.
