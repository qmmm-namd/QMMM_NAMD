<hr>

an on-the-fly QM/MM surface hopping code for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of complex large systems 

This QM/MM-NAMD code has been interfaced with various quantum chemical packages to perform static QM calculations at different electronic structure methods, including semi-empirical methods (e.g., OM2/MRCI) in the MNDO package, medium-accuracy methods (e.g., TDDFT) in the Gaussian package, and high-accuracy methods (e.g., CASSCF) in the Molpro package. At the same time, the Amber software is utilized for MM calculations. 


Some of the code is still in progress or in testing stage, which would be updated later, if possible.
